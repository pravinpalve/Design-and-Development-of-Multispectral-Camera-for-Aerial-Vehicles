# ASCEND-Aerial-Spectral-Camera-for-UAVs-and-Aircraft
The goal is to integrate 4 cameras with different spectral filters on the Raspi. Further, a thermal sensor shall also be integrated.
This Thesis involves the following tasks:

-             Literature survey

-             Mechanical arrangement of the camera setup (CAD of housing, 3D printing, …)

-             Selection of the filters for 4 cameras (green, red, red edge, …)

-             Integration of the thermal sensor (I2C interface)

-             Software evaluation

The purpose of this camera is agriculture monitoring. Many projects have already published their results. The Parrot SEQUOIA+ Multispektra Sensor is a commercial product that shows conceptually the desired outcome of the Thesis.
